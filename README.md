# BETTERFUND

Bascially, we design smart contract system which is intermediate between contributers and manager,so contributors has no need to send money to manager they can send 
their money to smart contact system,where their money remains safe. and then manager has to take permission from contributors to use their money for any their purpose
if contributors give permission then only manager can take money or No funds can be withdrawn without the approval of at least 50% of the approvers. 
manager of company or orgnization set  target means how many money needs for project,also set deadline or minimum contribution etc.or if target or deadline don't 
met means we cross our deadline and we dont get money that we set for our project in this case contributors can take their ethers from contract system.
before deadline contributors cant take their ethers that they donate.


problem statement of our project is  Crowdfunding is one of the most popular ways to raise funds for any project, cause or for helping any individual in need.
 With the onset of Covid we have seen a rise in Crowdfunding activities across the globe which includes small campaigns to help people get oxygen and medical help to large funds such as charity,or any social activity,business etc.
